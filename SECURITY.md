// ✅ Secure Configuration
let config = NetworkConfiguration(
    baseURL: "https://api.example.com",
    timeout: 30,
    retryPolicy: .exponentialBackoff(maxAttempts: 3),
    security: .strict, // Enable all security features
    certificatePinning: .enabled(pins: ["sha256/HASH..."]),
    enableLogging: false // Don't log in production
)

// ❌ Insecure Configuration  
let config = NetworkConfiguration(
    baseURL: "http://api.example.com", // HTTP instead of HTTPS
    security: .none, // Disabled security
    allowInvalidCertificates: true, // Dangerous!
    enableLogging: true // May log sensitive data
)
