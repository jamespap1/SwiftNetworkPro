## Security Best Practices

### üîß For Developers

When using SwiftNetworkPro in your applications:

```swift
// ‚úÖ Use enterprise security configuration
let config = NetworkConfiguration(
    baseURL: "https://api.example.com",
    security: .enterprise  // Enables all security features
)

// ‚úÖ Validate SSL certificates
config.certificatePinning = .enabled(certificates: yourCertificates)

// ‚úÖ Enable request/response encryption
config.encryption = .aes256

// ‚úÖ Use secure authentication
await client.setAuthentication(.bearer(secureToken))
```

### üèõÔ∏è For Enterprise Users

Additional security measures for enterprise deployments:

1. **Network Segmentation**: Deploy in isolated network segments
2. **HSM Integration**: Use hardware security modules for key storage
3. **Compliance Monitoring**: Enable audit logging and compliance reporting
4. **Regular Updates**: Maintain current versions with security patches
5. **Security Scanning**: Regular vulnerability assessments

### üîç Security Auditing

SwiftNetworkPro provides built-in security auditing:

```swift
// Enable comprehensive security monitoring
let observability = EnterpriseObservability.shared
await observability.enableSecurityAuditing()

// Monitor security events
let securityMetrics = await observability.getSecurityMetrics()
print("Security Score: \(securityMetrics.overallScore)")
```
