## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to actions taken outside of these spaces when they have a negative impact on community safety and well-being.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
